# Problem Statement

As you have seen, flood is one of the most occured disaster in India and all over the World. Main cause of flood is heavy rain, tsunamis, dam failures, unusual high tides etc. It takes too much time to recover from damage in flood affected area. Although we have enough resources but still  fail somewhere to overcome. Proper flood managament and recovery can lead to very less damage and we can overcome rapidly. If we predict it better then also the people living in particular area that is going to be affected can face it with less damage.

# Idea

We will develop a platform that will provide a better flood management and better predictions on the basis of previously occured floods. We will collect the data about information of weather, places, environment conditions of all flood affected areas and use machine learning to train the software to predict the better results. <br>
On this platform, a person can check for nearby available help and notify other users about his/her condition. Also we can use device sensors to autodetect the flood if user gets no chance to do so. So better flood recovery can be done this way. People who are not affected can also help the others if they get the information. That can easily be done through the platform.
